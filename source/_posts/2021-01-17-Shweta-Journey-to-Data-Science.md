Hey guys! I am Shweta Deshmukh starting off soon with Master's in Data Science at the University of Western Australia. I had done my undergraduation in Engineering in Information Technology (IT) field. I am currently working as a Software Engineer in Persistent Systems Ltd under IBM BU. When I was in my third year, I was introduced to Big Data subject. I had my first assignments in R and python. Learning these languages and the concepts developed my interest in big data.

In my fourth year, I learned Machine Learning subject. Right from collecting data, choosing a model, training it, evaluating it till it's prediction made me curious about prediction models.

When I started on my current project in IBM, I closely worked with huge amount of data. My current project involves a module which deals with huge amount of data collection from storage devices into the raw files. Thus, I have observed the various phases of data. Right from how the data is obtained in raw format, extracted to the format which is required called as information till it is stored. I also deal with the complex sql queries to store this data into DB. This process of extracing the required data from the raw data fascinates me. This process is a very superficial to what Data Science in depth is. Hence, it makes me curious to know how we can deal and manipulate the data with mathematical and statistical formulas.

I am super excited to dive deep into Data Science pathway and acquire insights on different analytical tools and methodologies used. I am looking forward to continuous learning and work to apply my knowledge for betterment.
