Hey guys! I am Shweta Deshmukh starting off soon with Master's in Data Science at the University of Western Australia. Being from an IT background, I am currently working as a Software Engineer in Persistent Systems Ltd under IBM BU. During my third year of engineering, I was introduced to Big Data subject for which I did my first assignments in R and Python. Learning these languages and the concepts developed my interest in big data.

When I started on my current project in IBM (Managed Storage Services), I closely work with huge amount of data. It involves a module which deals with data collection from storage devices into the raw files. Thus, I have observed the various phases of data. Right from how the data is obtained in raw format, extracted to the format which is required called as information till it is stored into databases. I also deal with the complex sql queries to store this data into DB (DB2 and MYSQL). I am working with my team on developing a billing dashboard which draws insights from the data collected to various reports. We are using chart JS for UI and FastAPI Python framework for API development. Working with data everyday and getting the useful insights from it fascinates me.

I am super excited to dive deep into Data Science pathway and acquire knowledge on different analytical tools and methodologies used. I am looking forward to continuous learning and work to apply my knowledge for betterment.
